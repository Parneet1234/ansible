Ansible is an open-source IT engine that automates application deployment, cloud provisioning, intra service orchestration, and other IT tools.
For example
There is one company and 100 enployees are working there  and have 100 of systems(servers) and there is one system adminstrator who is managing all the servers there
and there is task  for him/her to install some software on all the servers of company and will be be difficult to install software on all the systems manually and
it is very time consuming and chances of error is too much so in order to solve all these problems he/she has to use devops tool ansible to install software 
on all the systems by using yaml scripts .

steps to install ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt upgrade 
$ sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y ansible
$ ansible --version
for  example there is one main srver and server knode we have to connect main server to server knode via ssh
$ ssh-keygen
ssh knode@ip of knode
now to check whether ansible is install or not we have to check version ny ansible --version
now we have to host file of ansible 
cd /etc/ansible/hosts  or mkdir folder cd folder touch file nano file
nano hosts             or [name of webserver]
[name of webserver]    or ip of knode    ansible_ssh_user=root ansible_ssh_pass=anything
ip of knode server        save and exit
save and exit
ansible -i file servername -m ping -u knode

now make playbook with yml extension
---
- name: sample book
  hosts: webservers
  become: root
  tasks:
   - name: install httpd
     apt: 
        name: httpd
        state: latest     
   - name: run httpd 
     service: 
        name: httpd 
        state: started 
   - name: create content 
     copy: 
         content: "congrats  " 
         dest: /var/www/html/index.html  
ansible works on push 
it will push notifications to all  servers to update the software
now run playbook
 ansible-playbook sample.yaml
 Done 
 Thank you
